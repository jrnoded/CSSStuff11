                    There is a lot of fun backgrounds you can make with
                    a variety of the linear, conical, and radial gradients. It
                    is imressive to see them and be enough of a css guru to
                    build them.

                <p>
                    Only problem is that if you put them on an actual website
                    the would be just so much noise detracting from the message
                    of the site.

                    That being said a bit of Inkscape background image magic
                    sometimes become the message!
